The purpose of this project is to create an entire webpage based on a webpage provided by The Odin Project.

At this point in the Foundations class I will be displaying all of my knowledge within the scope of this webpage. Techniques that will be newly showcased is knowledge of Flexbox. I will be attempting to organize content on my webpage using things like <display: flexbox>, <align-items>, <justify-content>, understanding of the difference between margin, borders, and padding, and much more.

The goal is not to replicate the example webpage, but to use my own creativity and the other webpage as a guideline to showcase my skill-set. It will not be a completely accurate match to the other webpage provide, but will have a similar outline.
